# Some test title
So perhaps, you've generated some fancy text, and you're content that you can now copy and paste your fancy text in the comments section of funny cat videos, but perhaps you're wondering how it's even possible to change the font of your text? Is it some sort of hack? Are you copying and pasting an actual _font_?

Well, the answer is actually no - rather than generating fancy _fonts_, this converter creates _fancy symbols_. The explanation starts with [unicode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicode); an industry standard which creates the specification for thousands of different symbols and characters. All the characters that you see on your electronic devices, and printed in books, are likely specified by the unicode standard. sw
